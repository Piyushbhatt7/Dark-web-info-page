    <pre><h3  style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">       The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets: overlay networks that use the 
       Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.Through the dark web, private
       computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information, such as a user's
       location.The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although
       sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.
       The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large, popular
       networks such as <mark>Tor</mark>, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer
       to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature.The Tor dark web or <mark>onionland</mark> uses the traffic anonymization technique
       of onion routing under the network's top-level domain suffix .onion.</h3></pre>

     <pre> <h1> <b>                             Things Happened On Dark Web?   </b></h1></pre>
    
   <pre><h3 style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">     A December 2014 study by Gareth Owen from the <u>University of Portsmouth</u> found that the most commonly hosted type of content on Tor was <mark>child pornography</mark>,
     followed by <mark>black markets</mark>, while the individual sites with the highest traffic were dedicated to botnet operations (see attached metric).
     Many whistleblowing sites maintain a presence as well as political discussion forums.Sites associated with Bitcoin, fraud-related services,
     and mail order services are some of the most prolific. As of December 2020, the number of active Tor sites in .onion was estimated at 76,300
     (containing a lot of copies). Of these, 18 000 would have original content. In July 2017, Roger Dingledine, one of the three founders of the 
     Tor Project, said that Facebook is the biggest hidden service. The dark web comprises only 3% of the traffic in the Tor network.
     A February 2016 study from researchers at King's College London gives the following breakdown of content by an alternative category set, 
     highlighting the illicit use of .onion services</h3>

<pre><h3 style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">   Many hackers sell their services either individually or as a part of groups. Such groups include <mark>xDedic</mark>,
   <mark>hackforum</mark>, <mark>Trojanforge</mark>, <mark>Mazafaka</mark>, <mark>dark0de</mark> and the <mark>TheRealDeal</mark> darknet market. Some have been known to track and extort apparent pedophiles. Cyber
   crimes and hacking services for financial institutions and banks have also been offered over the dark web. Attempts to monitor this activity have 
   been made through various government and private organizations, and an examination of the tools used can be found in the Procedia Computer Science journal. 
   Use of Internet-scale DNS distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) attacks have also been made through leveraging the dark web. There are many scam .
   Onion sites also present which end up giving tools for download that are infected with <u>trojan horses or backdoors.</u></h3>

   <pre><h1><b>                                 Bitcoin services</b></h1></pre>
   

   <pre><h3 style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">     Bitcoin is one of the main <u>cryptocurrencies</u> used in dark web marketplaces due to the flexibility and relative anonymity of the currency. With Bitcoin, 
     people can hide their intentions as well as their identity.A common approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted Bitcoin into an online game currency (such as gold coins in World of Warcraft) 
     that will later be converted back into fiat currency.Bitcoin services such as tumblers are often available on Tor, and some – such as Grams – offer darknet market integration. A research study undertaken by 
     <u>Jean-Loup Richet</u>, a research fellow at ESSEC, and carried out with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, highlighted new trends in the use of Bitcoin tumblers for money laundering purposes.
     Due to its relevance in the digital world, Bitcoin has become a popular product for users to scam companies with.Cybercriminal groups such as DDOS"4" have led to over 140 cyberattacks on companies since the emergence of Bitcoins 
     in 2014. These attacks have led to the formation of other cybercriminal groups as well as Cyber Extortion.

    <pre><h1>                                  Illegal pornography    </h1></pre>

    
    <pre><h3 style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">      The type of content that has the most popularity on the dark web is illegal pornography—more specifically, child pornography. About 80% of its web traffic is related to accessing 
      child pornography despite it being difficult to find even on the dark web. A website called <mark>Lolita City</mark>, that has since been taken down, contained over <u>100 GB</u> of child pornographic media and had about 15,000 members.
      There is regular law enforcement action against sites distributing child pornography – often via compromising the site and tracking users' IP addresses. In 2015, the FBI investigated and took down a website called <mark>Playpen</mark>.
      At the time, <u>Playpen was the largest child pornography</u> website on the dark web with over 200,000 members. Sites use complex systems of guides, forums and community regulation. Other content includes sexualised torture and killing 
      of animals and <u>revenge porn</u>. In May 2021, German police said that they had dismantled one of the world's biggest child pornography networks on the dark web known as <mark>Boystown</mark>, the website had over 400,000 registered users. Four people
      had been detained in raids, including a man from Paraguay, on suspicion of running the network. Europol said several pedophile chat sites were also taken down in the German-led intelligence operation.

       In April 2015, Flashpoint received a 5 million dollar investment to help their clients gather intelligence from the deep and dark web.There are numerous carding forums, PayPal and Bitcoin trading websites as well as fraud and 
       counterfeiting services. Many such sites are scams themselves. Phishing via cloned websites and other scam sites are numerous,with darknet markets often advertised with fraudulent URLs.</h3></pre>

<br>

<pre><h3><b style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">     1. Phishing </b><i style="color: rgb(28, 89, 91);"> is one of the most common and worrying attacks because it is incredibly effective and relatively easy to implement. Criminals use fraudulent communication, such as fake emails, SMS, or websites to steal 
                 private information which is then sold or used to access further company data.</i> </h3></pre>
<pre><h3><b style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">     2. Malware </b><i style="color: rgb(29, 86, 90);"> is software designed to damage or compromise networks or devices such as computers, tablets, or mobile phones. The gleaned data is often used to infect other devices and access financial accounts.</i></h3></pre>
<pre><h3><b style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">     3. Identity theft</b><i style="color: rgb(28, 89, 91);"> is the stealing of personal data which is used to impersonate the individual. While this can be done by absconding with physical IDs, virtual identity theft allows criminals to use info such
                       as names, addresses, birthdays, Social Security Numbers, and more to create fake online profiles and accounts.</i></h3></pre>
<pre><h3><b style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">     4. Money laundering</b><i style="color: rgb(28, 89, 91);">occurs online because the Dark Web allows illicit funds to be transferred to and from multiple anonymous accounts, helping thieves secure ill-gotten gains.</i></h3></pre>

<pre><h1><b>                                      Terrorism</b></h1></pre>
<br>

<pre><h3><b style="color: rgb(36, 101, 103);">   Terrorist organizations took to the internet as early as the 1990s; however, the birth of the dark web attracted these organizations due to the anonymity, lack of regulation, social interaction, and easy accessibility. These groups have been taking advantage
   of the chat platforms within the dark web to inspire terrorist attacks. Groups have even posted "How To" guides, teaching people how to become and hide their identities as terrorists.The dark web became a forum for terrorist propaganda, guiding information, and most importantly, funding.
   With the introduction of Bitcoin, an anonymous transactions were created which allowed for anonymous donations and funding.
  
   By accepting Bitcoin, terrorists were now able to fund money to purchase weaponry. In 2018, an individual named Ahmed Sarsur was charged for attempting to purchase explosives and hire snipers to aid Syrian terrorists, as well as attempting to provide them financial support, all through the dark web.
   There are at least some real and fraudulent websites claiming to be used by ISIL (ISIS), including a fake one seized in Operation Onymous. With the increase of technology, it has allowed cyber terrorists to flourish by attacking the weaknesses of the technology.In the wake of the November 2015 Paris 
   attacks, an actual such site was hacked by an Anonymous-affiliated hacker group, GhostSec, and replaced with an advert for Prozac. The Rawti Shax Islamist group was found to be operating on the dark web at one time</b></h3></pre>
